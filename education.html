											<h3>The Specialist Program</h3>
											<p>The University of Toronto offers three types of programs, one of which is not widely used 
												in most universities. Aside from offering majors and minors 
												in different fields of study, they offer a specialist, which is often compared as double
												major. The curriculums for these type of programs are more demanding and they tend to be more 
												selective at the moment of accepting students into the program. It's usually the case
												that the course load for these programs is so heavy that you automatically qualify for
												other minors, in my case I minored in mathematics.

											<h3>Skill Diversification</h3>
											<p>Many people ask me what type of skills you develop with a degree in astrophyiscs,
												and my answer has always been that we are developers and analysts without a CS degree. The research
												that we do demands us to build effective pipelines to reduce crazy amounts of data
												which are often images, we build GUI's for these reduction processes, and we also use API's and
												scrappers to query data from multiple star/galaxy catalogs.

										<h3>Academic Perfomance & Extracurricular Activites</h3>
										<p>
											My HBSc Degree was conferred with distinction due to my outstanding academic performance. Achieving this
											distinction at the end of my degree took a lot of discipline and effort, specially, because at the end of
											my fall semester in first year I had a sessional GPA of 1.93. I had to completely reshape the way I approached
											things and become disciplined enough to stay consistent on my achievements. After first year my transcripts
											show steady monotonic growth in my CGPA which reflected this shift from first year.
										</p>
										<p>
											Aside from my academic achievement, I was also very active with universities sports, clubs and volunteering. I played
											for UofT's mens tri-campus teams during my first year, and after that I participated every year in intramural soccer
											for my college. I was president and finance director for the University of Toronto Amateur Astronomer's Society 
											(UTAAS) for 2 years. And, I would also volunteer every month for AstroTours which was a public outreach event 
											hosted out by the Astronomy department to connect with the general public and talk about our current research.
										</p>
										<h3>Public Outreach for Astronomy</h3>
										<p>
											I like being able to share the beauty of theoretical and observational Astronomy to the general public.
											As president of UTAAS during 2022 I paired up with the University of Toronto Mississauga Physics Club to 
											host a trip to Earl Rowe provincial park and observe the Perseid Meteor shower.
										</p>
										<p>
											AstroTours was one of my favorite events of the month because I would get to talk to people about how telescopes 
											work and show them planets through the telescopes at the top of McLenna Physical Laboratories. The first time 
											you see a planet on a telescope is something so memorable, and I enjoy being able to share that with people.
