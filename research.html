								<h3>The Story of Core-Collapse Supernova</h3>
								<p>At the end of hydrostatic burning, a massive star consists of concentric shells 
									that are the relics of its previous burning phases (hydrogen, helium, carbon, 
									neon, oxygen, silicon), with iron being the final stage of nuclear fusion. 
									This last element has the highest nuclear binding energy per nucleon, any further 
									reactions to create heavier nuclei are endothermic and hence impeded. At this point, 
									the iron core is supported against gravity by electron degeneracy pressure, but as more 
									iron is produced through fusion the mass of the core increases to a critical limit.</p>
								<p>When this critical limit is exceeded the electron degeneracy pressure can no longer 
									stabilize the core and it collapses. This collapse will continue until it is limited by 
									the strong nuclear force, which rebounds the falling inner core and send a shock wave outward 
									in a process called the “bounce”. This outward moving shock will crash supersonically into 
									the outer material that is falling, which stalls the shock wave, becoming an accretion shock. 
									In an observable supernova explosion, which is ultimately observable, this stalled shock can 
									continue moving outwards through some mechanism. This mechanism is still uncertain and is an active 
									problem in current supernovae research.
								</p>

								<h3>KSP-ZN7090-2020f</h3>
								<p>
									The manuscript for this supernova is still in preparation, thus, we are not allowed to share too 
									many details about this peculiar event. Howeve, there are some features worth sharing and discussing; 
									this supernova is highly luminous and it has strong ionized hydrogen features. This is particularly 
									interesting because super luminous supernovae don't show hydrogen in their spectrum, however, for ZN7090
									hydrogen is the strongest feature in the spectrum.
								</p>
								<p>
									The observed BVi, light curves suggest the powering mechanism for the early stage 
									is a shock breakout at opossed to radioactive decay. We also characterized the supernova to be a type II-L 
									which indicates there is not sufficient hydrogen recombination happening at the envelope.
								</p>
								<p>
									We have attempted to use a couple of analytical shock breakout models to determine the progenitor
									and explosion parameters for this supernova, however, due the high luminosity and short rise time 
									many of these models fail to provide physical parameters or good fitting results.
