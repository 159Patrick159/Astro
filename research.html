								<h3>The Story of Core-Collapse Supernova</h3>
								<p>At the end of hydrostatic burning, a massive star consists of concentric shells 
									that are the relics of its previous burning phases (hydrogen, helium, carbon, 
									neon, oxygen, silicon), with iron being the final stage of nuclear fusion. 
									This last element has the highest nuclear binding energy per nucleon, any further 
									reactions to create heavier nuclei are endothermic and hence impeded. At this point, 
									the iron core is supported against gravity by electron degeneracy pressure, but as more 
									iron is produced through fusion the mass of the core increases to a critical limit.</p>
								<p>When this critical limit is exceeded the electron degeneracy pressure can no longer 
									stabilize the core and it collapses. This collapse will continue until it is limited by 
									the strong nuclear force, which rebounds the falling inner core and send a shock wave outward 
									in a process called the “bounce”. This outward moving shock will crash supersonically into 
									the outer material that is falling, which stalls the shock wave, becoming an accretion shock. 
									In an observable supernova explosion, which is ultimately observable, this stalled shock can 
									continue moving outwards through some mechanism. This mechanism is still uncertain and is an active 
									problem in current supernovae research.
								</p>
								<hr />
								<h3>KSP-ZN7090-2020f</h3>
								<p>The manuscript for this supernova is still in preparation, so we are unable to share too many details 
									about this peculiar event. However, there are some notable features worth discussing. This supernova 
									is highly luminous and exhibits strong ionized hydrogen features. This is particularly interesting because 
									we believe the shock from the supernova is ionizing the circumstellar material (CSM), leading to a narrow feature 
									superimposed on a broader H-alpha emission line.
								</p>
								<p>The observed BVi light curves suggest that the powering mechanism in the early stage is likely a shock breakout 
									rather than radioactive decay. However, the late-stage tail phase is unusually luminous, indicating the presence 
									of significant radioactive material at this stage. We have also characterized the supernova as a Type II-L, which 
									implies insufficient hydrogen recombination in the envelope and thus the absence of a plateau phase.
								</p>
								<p>We have attempted to use several analytical shock breakout models to determine the progenitor and explosion parameters 
									of this supernova. However, due to the high luminosity and short rise time, many of these models fail to yield physical 
									parameters or good fits. It appears that the presence of CSM must be considered to accurately model this extreme behavior.
								</p>

								<h3>Type Ia SN Color Characterization</h3>
								<p>We conducted a systematic analysis of the early multi-band light curves and colors of 19 Type Ia Supernovae (SNe) from the 
									Korea Microlensing Telescope Network SN Program. Our findings revealed three distinct populations of Type Ia SNe based 
									on their color evolution and other characteristics, suggesting potential differences in their production channels.</p>
