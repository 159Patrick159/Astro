							<h2>Experience</h2>
							<p>My skill set ranges from photometry routines for calculating the luminosity of stars to 
								XGBooster machines for classifying employee turnover rates. I have a variety of
								skills and years of experience which help me adapt to multiple situations, and I love
								talking about them and teaching them to more people.

										<h3>Google Advance Data Analytics Professional Certificate</h3>
										<p>Comprhensive program that provides experience in exploratory data analysis, 
											data visualization, hypothesis testing, logistic regression, and 
											machine learning models like Naive Bayes, decision trees, random forests and 
											booster machines. It also ensures  Excellent understanding and proficiency of platforms for effcective data analysis, 
											cleaning, and visualization, including spreadsheets, Python, and Tableau. 
										 </p>
										<p>Throughout the 7 courses of this certificate I had to prepare executive plans and presentations for 
											each end-of-course project. This presentations simulated business problems which I had to provide 
											solution to using what I had learned in that couse. All the final course projects can be found on my GitHub 
											along with the exectuive planning and presentation documents.

										<h3>Lead Instructor at Mathnasium</h3>
										<p>
											My commitment to teaching and passion for mathematics led me to become a leadinstructor at Mathnasium in a 
											short period of time. As the lead instructor for a brand new centre I oversaw daily operations, trained 
											new instructors on Mathnasium teaching techniques, conducted diagnostic assessments to identify student's 
											strengths, weaknessess and learning gaps. I would review student progress regularly specially highschool 
											students, and adjust as needed based on school curriculums, progress and baseline understandings. In addition 
											to upholding the Mathnasium standards on all of my instructors I would be the point of contact for most of the 
											highschool students parents. Due to my experience with the Ontario math curriculums from grade 9 to 12, I knew
											what where the core subjects I wanted my students to focus on and work on during their sessions.
										</p>
										<p>
											In addition to these responsabilities I would also give the team ideas for activities and games we could play 
											with students to catch their interest in mathematics. Some of these ideas were using the binary number systemat 
											in cards to guess the students number, or using logic engineering to solve true or false riddles in a game called
											"Knights and Knaves". I also created a short summer camp activity where I taught students how to read and write 
											Python code. I would also love teaching kids about astronomical principles such as what causes the seasons or talking 
											about stars and galaxies in general.
